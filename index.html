            <h4>Abstract</h4>
            <p id="abstract">
              In early eighteenth century New York, Haudenosaunee, Dutch, English, other European settlers, and enslaved African people worshipped together at Queen Anne's Chapel in Fort Hunter.  The 1711 construction of this fort and the chapel within it was intended to tie together the many contentious settler ethnic groups and neighboring Mohawks in a single British and Anglican community.  This article uses social network analysis to examine ties created between congregants by Anglican baptism.  The relations documented by these baptisms made visible the ways in which ethnic and racial boundaries were created, maintained, and occasionally bridged.  In the network created by baptismal connections between parents, children, and godparents, women's connections functioned as the primary social glue connecting the disparate ethnic groups within the congregation.  Haudenosaunee parents used Anglican baptism to reinforce matrilineal clan ties, while Indigenous and settler women across the congregation were the primary connectors between otherwise separated ethnic groups.  Only one Dutch female trade connected the Indigenous and settler portions of the congregation, challenging scholarly focus on male diplomats as the primary intercultural mediators in early New York.  Both settler and Indigenous women navigated cross-cultural contact differently than their male counterparts, and those patterns of contact and mediation have not always been archivally visible because of their gendered differences.

            <p id="1">The 1711 construction of Queen Anne's Chapel in Fort Hunter was intended to serve many goals for the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) and New York colonial leaders who requested it, the British metropolitan officials who funded it, and the Haudenosaunee and settler congregants who attended it. Peter Schuyler, mayor of Albany, and the "Four Indian Kings" (actually three young Mohawks and a Mahican without real political authority) traveled to London in 1710 to more firmly tie British imperial interests to the defense of New York and Native communities against French incursion.<label for="fn1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" data-step="6" data-intro="Footnotes are collapsed in the text and listed at the end of the essay.

            <p id="2">The disparate ethnic communities within the Fort Hunter congregation practiced baptism and sponsorship in different ways.  The Mohawk community of Tiononderoge, where most of the Haudenosaunee Fort Hunter congregants lived, had a long history of mixed material culture in which European goods were used and reworked to fit Indigenous contexts, as well as a hybrid practice of Christianity which blended Indigenous, Catholic, and Protestant elements.<label for="fn3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn3" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">On Mohawk mixed material culture, see Kevin Moody and Charles L.

            <p id="3">In this mixed landscape, people from two Native nations with very different relations to settler communities, European ethnic groups at odds with one another, and enslaved Africans all attended church and had their children baptized at Queen Anne's Chapel. The relations documented by these baptisms made visible the ways in which ethnic and racial boundaries were created, maintained, and occasionally bridged.  In the network created by baptismal connections between parents, children, and godparents, women's connections functioned as the primary social glue connecting the disparate ethnic groups within the congregation.  One of the few experiences most women shared in common across race and ethnicity was the use of baptism to connect otherwise distinct ethnic and racial communities.  In the most prominent example within the Fort Hunter congregation, Anna Peek, an illiterate Dutch woman trader and tavern owner, functioned as the sole intercultural go-between who connected the otherwise separate Indigenous and settler portions of the congregation.  In eighteenth century New York, male go-betweens signaled their status as mediators with performatively mixed clothing in diplomatic spaces.<label for="fn11" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn11" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">On male intercultural mediators, see Daniel K Richter, "Cultural Brokers and Intercultural Politics: New York-Iroquois Relations, 1664-1701," The Journal of American History 75, no. 1 (1988): 40-67; Richter, "Some of Them": 471-84; Richter, Ordeal; Edward Countryman, "Toward a Different Iroquois History," The William and Mary Quarterly 69, no. 2 https://doi.org/10.5309/willmaryquar.69.2.0347 (2012): 347-60; Mandell, "'Turned Their Minds to Religion'": 211-42; Eric Hinderaker, "Translation and Cultural Brokerage," in Philip J. Deloria and Neal Salisbury, eds., A Companion to American Indian History (Malden, Mass.: Wiley-Blackwell, 2004), 357-75; Shannon, "Dressing for Success": 13-42.<a class="badge badge-secondary" href="#fullnote-11">full note</a></span>  Unlike these male mediators, Peek appears in very few other archival sources and her role as intercultural go-between at Fort Hunter was a result of her prosaic daily interactions with her Indigenous neighbors.  Her prominence connecting the otherwise separate Haudenosaunee and settler portions of the Fort Hunter congregation suggests that women navigated intercultural contact differently than did men in the same community, within the social and domestic space of daily contacts built up over time to fictive kinship, rather than the performative and temporary space of diplomatic meetings.</p>

            <p id="4">Within the otherwise separate settler and Indigenous portions of the congregation, women used baptism to cement ties between ethnic and clan subcommunities.  In addition to Peek, settler women who married men of different ethnicities used baptism to maintain ties to their natal ethnic communities, while Haudenosaunee women used Anglican baptism to reinforce matrilineal clan connections.  These parallel uses of baptism fit the shared religious rite to each group's social and cultural needs even as the act of baptism made visible the boundaries between ethnic and racial groups within the congregation.  Haudenosaunee women in this community did not intermarry with settler men.<label for="fn12" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn12" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">Susan Sleeper-Smith, ed., Rethinking the Fur Trade: Cultures of Exchange in an Atlantic World (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2009); Susan Sleeper-Smith, Indigenous Prosperity and American Conquest: Indian Women of the Ohio River Valley, 1690-1792, (Chapel Hill: Omohundro Institute and University of North Carolina Press, 2018); Susan Sleeper-Smith, Indian Women and French Men: Rethinking Cultural Encounter in the Western Great Lakes, (Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 2001); Michele Mitchell, "Turns of the Kaleidoscope: Race, Ethnicity, and Analytical Patterns in American Women's and Gender History."

The relationships of aunt and uncle, especially maternal ones, are among the most culturally important familial relationships for Haudenosaunee families; in eighteenth century diplomacy, the metaphor of uncle and nephew denoted obligations of education, protection, and respect.<label for="fn13" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn13" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">For discussion of familial diplomatic metaphors in the eigtheenth century, see Nancy Shoemaker, "An Alliance between Men: Gender Metaphors in Eighteenth-Century American Indian Diplomacy East of the Mississippi," Ethnohistory 46, no. 2 (1999): 239-63; Erik R.

As a snapshot of this mixed-ethnicity community, social network analysis of the baptism register offers a window on both the social connections among the many ethnic groups living in early New York, as well as one view of what settlers like Barclay were able to see of their Indigenous neighbors' social connections.  The network examined here is solely reconstructed from what Barclay recorded in the Fort Hunter register analyze not only who was connected to who in this congregation, but also to analyze who it was visible to.<label for="fn14" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn14" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">Digital humanities methods have been critiqued for reifying a focus on "big data," including large bodies of print sources that are easily processed by computer and by definition outside the capacity of any one scholar to read completely.

Mohawks adopted Anglican practice, but they did so in ways that fit their own cultural needs despite the intent of Barclay and English settlers like him.  A careful reading of godparentage connections in both the settler and Haudenosaunee portions of the congregation reveal that Mohawk Anglicans at Fort Hunter used Christian rites like baptism to reinforce rather than replace Indigenous kinship structures.<label for="fn22" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn22" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">On Indigenous survivance and settler colonialism, see J.

            <p id="12"> The density of connections within subcommunities of the Fort Hunter settler congregation reflected ethnic differences in the practice of baptismal sponsorship.  As the most densely interconnected subcommunity at Fort Hunter, the Dutch subcommunity formed the heart of the settler congregation. Historically, Dutch families in New Netherland named very few baptismal sponsors or godparents, reflecting the relatively lower emphasis on godparents as spiritual educators in the Dutch Reformed Church.<label for="fn36" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn36" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">Tebbenhoff, 567-585; Simon Middleton, "Order and Authority in New Netherland: The 1653 Remonstrance and Early Settlement Politics," The William and Mary Quarterly 67, no. 1 (2010): 31-68, https://doi.org/10.5309/willmaryquar.67.1.31; Joyce D.

The Fort Hunter register suggests that as these Dutch families intermarried with newer English arrivals, English practices of godparentage became more prevalent.  Even after the English takeover of New York, seventeenth century Dutch families had typically only named two sponsors, often the child's grandparents.<label for="fn37" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn37" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">Charles B.

The density of connections within the Dutch subcommunity at Fort Hunter and the prominence of intermarried Dutch women as bridges to other ethnic subcommunities within the settler congregation suggests that Dutch women used participation in Anglican baptism to solidify ethnic and religious ties even in the absence of a Dutch Reformed church.</p>
            <p id="13"> The English subcommunity, which included William Johnson, his common law wife Catherine Weisenberg, and other British officers and their wives, had a lower density than the intermarried Dutch subcommunity.<label for="fn39" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn39" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">O'Toole, 45-47.<a class="badge badge-secondary" href="#fullnote-39">full note</a></span>  The distinction between the Dutch and English subcommunities within this network is not a firm one and is much less stable than the distinctions between other subcommunities. At many modularities, the Dutch and English subcommunities were collapsed into one modularity class, and at other resolutions were fractured into several modularity classes. The other subcommunities discussed here were more firm in their boundaries across different resolutions.  This indicates that Dutch and English settlers in New York had become thoroughly entangled and intermarried by the 1730s, yet maintained some ethnic distinction.</p>
            <p id="14"> Part of this distinction came from their respective ties to British colonial infrastructure.  The Dutch families at Fort Hunter had long-standing connections to the fur trade at Schenectady or Albany, but the English subcommunity was more closely connected to figures like Anna Peek who bridged the settler and Indigenous parts of the congregation.  Many of the settlers in the English subcommunity had military or political ties to the British colonial infrastructure, either through formal commissions or through intermittent work as translators.  This may represent a shift in the balance of power from the more trade-focused Dutch Commissioners of Indian Affairs at Albany towards the newer British military-diplomatic apparatus represented by more recent arrivals like William Johnson.  As Johnson attempted to consolidate his political and economic power, he became ever more visible as the primary point of connection between settler and Indigenous leaders.<label for="fn40" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn40" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">On the tensions between Johnson and the Albany Commissioners, see Allen W.

            <p id="15"> While the Dutch and English subcommunities were highly integrated and formed the center of the settler congregation, other European ethnic subcommunities at Fort Hunter were both more marginal and distinct within the congregation network.  The density of connections within other subcommunities reflects the extent of their own integration with the Dutch and English subcommunities and their assimilation to Anglican baptismal practice.  As German religious refugees left Europe in the early decades of the eighteenth century, the number of German Reformed and Lutheran churches in Pennsylvania and western New York doubled between 1730 and 1740.<label for="fn41" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn41" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">Patricia U.

Mary Linch and Mary Quackenbus anchored the Scotch-Irish subcommunity to the English and Dutch subcommunities.  William Corry attained his prominence because of his money, land, and political influence, but these two relatively undocumented women functioned similarly as bridges despite their respective marriages to unnoteworthy men.

The enslaved Africans in the Fort Hunter congregation were thoroughly enmeshed in the white settler network despite dense ties between one another, whereas the Haudenosaunee community shared kinship ties with the white community only along its borders. Haudenosaunee communities did have contact with and occasionally adopted African individuals in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, but those ties were made within the context of Haudenosaunee practices rather than Anglican baptism.<label for="fn54" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn54" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">Hart, "For the Good of Our Souls"; William Bryan Hart, "Black 'Go-Betweens' and the Mutability of 'Race,' Status, and Identity on New York's Pre-Revolutionary Frontier," in Contact Points: American Frontiers from the Mohawk Valley to the Mississippi, 1750-1830, ed.

            <p id="20">The gendered connections between Africans and white sponsors at Fort Hunter underlines the importance of property ownership in sponsoring enslaved children, themselves property.  Within the framework of Anglican baptism, an enslaved child and family's documentable ties were centered on the white household in which they were enslaved.  White men were the main sponsors for enslaved children, both within their own households and in others' households.

Baby Mary was born to Primus and Rachel Speck in 1743, and when Wemp drew up his will four years later, the little girl and her father, along with eight other enslaved people, were bequeathed separately to various Wemp relatives, including Wemp's son Isaac, who himself sponsored the baptism of another enslaved child.<label for="fn57" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn57" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">Mary, 1743, Barclay Register; "Will of Johannes Myndert Wemple, March 5, 1747/8," in The Wemple Family by William C.

            <p id="21">Very few white women sponsored enslaved children, and those who did so were prominent property owners themselves. Only two white women, Mary Phillipse and Anna Peek, stood as godparents to enslaved children.  Both sponsored baptisms for enslaved children outside of their own households.  Their prominence as property owners at Fort Hunter suggests that baptism and education of enslaved children was viewed as part of wealthy white women's responsibilities within and beyond their households.<label for="fn58" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn58" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">Clark and Gould, 409-448; Susanah Shaw Romney, "Intimate Networks and Children's Survival in New Netherland in the Seventeenth Century," Early American Studies 7, no. 2 (2009): 270-308; Sue Peabody, "Madeleine's Children: Slaves from Isle Bourbon (Present-Day Réunion), Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries," Clio.

Enslaved children's baptisms formalized not only their parents' religious choices, or their enslavers' assertion of religious and domestic control, but also created an opportunity for whites to solidify political and economic ties through the enactment of fictive kinship to an enslaved child.</p>
            <p id="22">The network of connections between the Wemp and Speck families offer a stark illustration of the social and legal erasure of enslaved people's ties outside the household in which they were enslaved.  The most-connected enslaved African individuals were both women, Rachel Speck and Elizabeth Powel, but their primary connections were with prominent white men. Speck and Powel lacked documented direct connections with one another in this network, although members of their families sponsored one anothers' children.  The indirect connections between these two prominent enslaved African women suggests that the enslaved Specks and Powels shared relationships that may not have been visible to Barclay and other white authorities.  Enslaved women were in many ways invisible in early America, and their sketchy presence in the Fort Hunter congregation is typical of the documentary erasure of enslaved people generally and enslaved women specifically.<label for="fn61" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn61" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">Marisa J.

            <p id="23">Anna Peek held much less property than Philipse and property of a different kind, positioning her differently within the social fabric of the Fort Hunter congregation.  Like Philipse, Peek used the baptism of enslaved children to create and maintain social ties to prominent white men in the Mohawk Valley.  Anna and her husband Joseph Clement witnessed the baptism of the enslaved Primus and Rachel Speck's son Joseph, alongside slaver owner John Wemp, descendant of one of the wealthiest settler landholding families in the Schectady-Albany area.<label for="fn63" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn63" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">Joseph, 1735, Barclay, "Register of Baptisms."; Hudson-Mohawk Genealogical and Family Memoirs, edited by Cuyler Reynolds (New York: Lewis Historical Publishing Company, 1911), 1663.

            <p id="24">Unlike Mary Philipse, the source of Peek's relative wealth also brought her into daily contact with Haudenosaunee people whose children's baptisms she also witnessed, and it was these ties William Johnson likely sought to leverage with the baptism of the enslaved infant Joseph.  Peek operated a tavern with her husband that served both the Mohawk and settler communities near Fort Hunter, and from this tavern traded cloth and other fur trade goods with their Indigenous customers.  Joseph Clement and Anna Peek both had longstanding ties to the Mohawk Valley region and more recent ties to the fur trade.

            <p id="26">	Johnson's attempts to parlay these social connections to his own economic benefit soon soured his relations with his more established neighbors.  As more experienced traders, Peek and Clement sold a range of goods from their tavern and served alcohol to both settler and Indigenous customers, a practice which was intermittently illegal in the early eighteenth century without a license.  As early as 1720, almost twenty years before Johnson arrived in New York, Mohawk chief Hendrick accused Joseph Clement and three others of selling rum to Indians "so plentifully as if it were water out of a fountain."<label for="fn70" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn70" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">3 September 1720 "Att a Meeting of the President Collo Peter Schuyler Esqr and the Commissioners of the Indian Affairs."

            <p id="31">There is of course no denying Johnson and Montour's connections or influence in Native-settler relations in the region.  Johnson's papers form part of what might be considered the "canon" of Iroquois studies and especially Iroquois intercultural diplomatic history, and Johnson painted the Clements as alternatively unimportant and subversive.  Johnson, who through his self-promotion efforts would become the British Superintendent for Indian Affairs in 1756, and Montour both appear as relatively uninfluential figures in this network as measured by their betweenness centrality.

Men like Johnson and Montour functioned as intercultural mediators who bridged European and Native spaces, but less archivally prominent individuals like Peek exerted more influence in the network of every day social and kinship interactions.  Both Montour and Johnson are known from other records to have had diplomatic, economic, familial ties with both the Haudenosaunee and English populations in the Albany area.  Their relative lack of connections in the Fort Hunter network suggest that they were less active and prominent within in the sphere of fictive kinship ties and domestic interactions. This should be taken both as an indication of this method's limitations in revealing the totality of interpersonal ties, and as an indication of the gendered ways in which women and men navigated cross-cultural contact.</p>

            <p id="32"> The Haudenosaunee portion of the congregation differed in significant ways from the settler portion of the congregation in the structure of its subcommunities, in the factors that separated its subcommunities, and the structural role of women.  The Haudenosaunee portion of the congregation had a lower average density of connections like some subcommunities of the settler portion of the congregation, possibly reflecting a continuity of French Catholic sponsorship practices among Mohawks.  Barclay and his predecessors noted that many adults at Tiononderoge were "baptised in Canada" and Catholic baptismal practice may have endured among the Mohawk congregants, especially those with family in the Laurentian communities of Kahnawake and St. Regis.<label for="fn86" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn86" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">On Catholic practices of godparentage in New France, see Lisa J.

            <p id="33">Like the English and Dutch settler subcommunities, the two largest Haudenosaunee subcommunities--the Canostens-Oseragighte and the Kaghtereni-Uttijagaroondi subcommunities--were closely entangled. However, the Haudenosaunee portion of the Fort Hunter congregation had fewer subcommunities, and its subcommunities were divided primarily along clan lines.  The Haudenosaunee subcommunities were much more stable than the settler subcommunities across multiple resolutions.<label for="fn89" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn89" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">Clan identifications were made here using Sivertsen.<a class="badge badge-secondary" href="#fullnote-89">full note</a></span>  Although clan and ethnicity are both social constructions of kinship affiliation, Haudenosaunee clans functioned very differently from European nationalities or ethnicities like the Scots-Irish or Palatine divisions of the settler portion of the congregation. Haudenosaunee clans spanned the Six Nations, with clan members from different nations considered kin descended from a common matrilineal female ancestor. Members of the Turtle, Wolf, and Bear clans within the Mohawk nation were related to members of those clans in the Oneida nation.<label for="fn90" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn90" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">On Iroquois clan structure, see Elisabeth Tooker, "The League of the Iroquois: Its History, Politics, and Ritual," in Handbook of North American Indians, vol. 15, 1978, 418-41; JNB Hewitt and William Fenton, "The Requickening Address of the Iroquois Condolence Council," Journal of the Washington Academy of the Sciences vol. 34 no. 3, 65-85; Sivertsen, 12-13.<a class="badge badge-secondary" href="#fullnote-90">full note</a></span></p>

            <p id="34">In the Fort Hunter congregation, clans also spanned subcommunities because eighteenth century Haudenosaunee marriages were typically exogamous, meaning that clan members had to marry outside their clan.<label for="fn91" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn91" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">JNB Hewitt, "A Constitutional League of Peace in the Stone Age of America: The League of the Iroquois and its Constitution."

            <p id="35">Because Haudenosaunee baptismal sponsorship often created ties between members of different clans, Haudenosaunee subcommunities were not divided along clan lines. However, certain subcommunities were composed of different alignments of clans, suggesting that members of some Haudenosaunee clans engaged differently with the nearby settler communities. The alignment of subcommunities within the Fort Hunter congregation shows that divisions within Mohawk community at Tiononderoge were products of clan affiliation rather than factionalization or fracture due to colonialism. The Haudenosaunee subcommunities were relatively densely connected with one another, especially compared to the fractured settler portion of the congregation. The alignments of the Haudenosaunee subcommunities, at least as visible at Tiononderoge in the 1730s and 1740s, does not neatly align with the supposedly pro-French and pro-British politics which historians have argued drove Haudenosaunee factionalism. Rather, clan intermarriage and religious denomination were more salient factors in subcommunity formation.</p>
            <p id="36">The two Haudenosaunee subcommunities with direct connection to the Bridge community, the Canasteje-Oseragighte and Kaghtereni-Uttijagaroondi subcommunities, were mainly composed of individuals from the Turtle and Bear clans. The Kaghtereni-Uttijagaroondi subcommunity also included a small cluster Wolf clan members, but these were separated by many degrees of connection from the bridge to the settler portion of the congregation. The Kenderago-Canostens subcommunity was most distantly connected to the settler portion of the congregation, and was mainly composed of Wolf and Bear clan members. This may reflect clan engagement with settler communities broadly. William Johnson had a long-standing connection to the Mohawk Turtle clan through Molly and Joseph Brant's stepfather Brant Kanagaradunka,<label for="fn96" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn96" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">O'Toole, 105, 121-124, 172, 334, Sivertsen, 127-142, 163-171; Peggy Dymond Leavey, Molly Brant: Mohawk Loyalist and Diplomat.

The separation of the Kenderago-Canostens subcommunity may also have been denominational. By 1751, Abraham was a lay preacher and appointed an Anglican Reader, as well as a noted follower of New Light preacher Jonathan Edwards sometimes at odds with the High Anglican aligned Barclay.<label for="fn97" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn97" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">SWJP, 9:52-54 and 62; DRCHNY, 6:589-590; Sivertsen 144-149.<a class="badge badge-secondary" href="#fullnote-97">full note</a></span>  The relative distance of Wolf clan members from the settler portion of the congregation may reflect matrilineal clan approaches to engaging settler communities, religious divisions within the Haudenosaunee community or differences with Barclay, or patterns of clan intermarriage.</p>
            <p id="37">Women's clan affiliations in the Fort Hunter network are difficult to determine. Most of the individuals in this network whose clans are known are men, because they appeared more frequently in recorded interactions with Europeans and European recording practices preferentially documented men's biographical details and patrilineages. Many of the women do not appear in other archival records, or appear so rarely that it is difficult to build a concrete picture of their roles in their communities despite what is known of Haudenosaunee women's roles in governance and matrilineages.<label for="fn98" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn98" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">Kane, 89-144.<a class="badge badge-secondary" href="#fullnote-98">full note</a></span>  Haudenosaunee men additionally appear much more influential than Haudenosaunee women as measured by their betweenness centrality in large part because the calculation of betweenness as measured throughout the network privileges those individuals who had a connection to the narrow bridge between the settler and Haudenosaunee portions of the congregation. By this measure, the most influential individuals in the network were Anna Peek and Esras Teganderasse, occasional preacher and schoolteacher, and son of Canasteje.</p>

            <p id="38">As measured by her betweenness, Canasteje herself appears as rather uninfluential in the network, even though she was one of the earliest Haudenosaunee members of the Dutch Reformed Church and sponsored more baptisms than did her son Esras.<label for="fn99" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn99" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">Sivertsen, 26.<a class="badge badge-secondary" href="#fullnote-99">full note</a></span>  As measured by the number of connections to others rather than betweenness, Haudenosaunee women appear much more prominent in the network, on par with men's prominence. Additionally, if betweenness centrality is calculated separately on the Haudenosaunee and settler portions of the network, Haudenosaunee and settler women appear much more influential internally within their respective portions of the congregation. Although Anna Peek's prominence as an intercultural connector complicates the story of the male intercultural mediator, an emphasis on intercultural connection nevertheless elides the influence of both Native and settler women within their own communities.</p>
            <p id="39">Despite their similarities as measured by internal connections, Haudenosaunee and settler women differed significantly in their structural roles within their portions of the congregation. In the Scots-Irish, Dutch, and English subcommunities, connections were mostly heterogeneous, with men and women having balanced numbers of connections with both men and women, while in the Palatine subcommunity, individuals' connections were more homogeneous with members of their own gender. Connections between all settler subcommunities were also almost all between men; a few settler women like Engeltie Hansen, Mary Quackenbus, and Cornelia Bowen had connections across subcommunities, perhaps as a result of intermarriage, but these were the exception. Haudenosaunee connections across all subcommunities were mainly heterogeneous, but women were the main connectors between subcommunities. Men's influence as measured by betweenness derived from their role as hubs of subcommunities, while women more often connected subcommunities or otherwise unconnected clusters within subcommunities. Elizabeth Anoghsookte, Elizabeth Teganderasse, and Lydia Kaweghnoke all acted as anchors who connected the Bridge subcommunity to the main body of the Haudenosaunee portion of the congregation, while Jacamine Kaghtereni, Margaret Oseragighte, Canasteje, Christina Brant's wife, Catherine Kiliane's wife, Catharine Tewajewasha, Margaret Kinsiago, Margaret Jughahise, Gesina Canostens, Ester Kenderago, and Mary Serehowane all connected the main subcommunities or smaller internal clusters.<label for="fn100" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn100" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">On Haudenosaunee women's roles in their communities and the importance of matrilineages, see Barbara Alice Mann.

            <p id="40">As tensions escalated between Britain and France in the years leading to the Seven Years' War, divisions between settlers and Haudenosaunee, and Haudenosaunee perceptions of divisions between settler subcommunities, became ever more worrisome to British imperial officials. In late 1756, a Dutch-heritage officer of the New York colonial militia went hunting with an Onondaga acquaintance. The Onondaga man's knowledge of ethnic tensions within colonial New York proved unsettling enough for the officer to report to William Johnson. "The Indian knowing him to be of Dutch extract, began to speak words reflecting on the English, and told [him], it would be good that the Albany people or Dutch with the Indians should join and drive the English out of they country. Schuyler says he was surprised to hear the fellow talk in that manner, and turning to him said, we are all one people and under one King."<label for="fn101" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn101" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">Sir William Johnson to the Earl of Loudon, "Information of an Onondaga Indian Called by the English Corn-Milk." Fort Johnson, March 4, 1757, Huntington Library, Loudon Papers, LO 2971.<a class="badge badge-secondary" href="#fullnote-101">full note</a></span>  Johnson feared such reports, cautioning his superiors that such visible ethnic divisions would discourage the resolutely neutral Haudenosaunee Confederacy from fully supporting British efforts against French Canada.  The distance Haudenosaunee families maintained between themselves and their settler neighbors contributed to this tension, creating a diplomatic landscape mediated by many non-English and non-offical go-betweens like Peek.</p>
            <p id="41">Social network analysis of the Fort Hunter baptismal network complicates the picture of the male intercultural mediator, and suggests that Haudenosaunee women used Anglican baptism to reinforce inter-clan connections. Even within a single congregation, settler ethnic groups used the practice of baptismal sponsorship to define ethnic community boundaries, while the Haudenosaunee portion of the congregation mediated their contact with the settler community through a sparsely documented Dutch woman, Anna Peek. Peek's prominence in the fictive kinship context of intercultural baptismal ties suggests that male intermediaries like Michael Montour and William Johnson who are documented through the archive of the diplomatic encounter were not the only intercultural mediators, and in fact may have been relatively uninfluential in the daily contact that produced fictive kinship ties of baptismal sponsorship. Haudenosaunee subcommunities fell along clan rather than ethnic lines, suggesting that even within a single national community like the Mohawk village of Tiononderoge, matrilineal clans approached engagement with settler communities with different goals. Haudenosaunee women acted as bridges between these subcommunities.  Both settler and Indigenous women navigated cross-cultural contact differently than their male counterparts, and those patterns of contact and mediation have not always been archivally visible because of their gendered differences.</p>
